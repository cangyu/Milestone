# naSTL
naSTL stands for "Not Another STL",which means that it's not a simple copy or imitation of the STL.
## motivation
I wrote the project to master the basic data structures and algorithms stated in textbooks and I found it interesting to start from scratch!
## declaration
The framework is based on the course project of DS2016, ACM Class, SJTU, and I'm full of admiration for the wonderful work they've done!
